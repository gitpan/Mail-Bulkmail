Revision history for Perl extension Mail::Bulkmail.

1.01  Wed Sep, 01, 1999
        - Fixed a bug in the email validation routine which would cause the module to hang severely
          on certain malformed addresses.  All is once again right with the world
        - Altered default date generation to be RFC 1123 compliant (4 digit year)
        - changed date generation so that it adds a space after the comman after the day.
          This is because of a bug in Outlook that wouldn't recognize the date w/o the space.


1.00  Wed Aug 18, 1999 
        - First public release onto CPAN
      
0.93  Thu Aug 12, 1999
        - Re-vamped the documentation substantially.

0.92  Thu Aug 12, 1999
        - Started adding a zero in front of the version name, just like I always should have
        - Changed accessing of non-standard headers so that they have to be accessed and retrieved
          via the "headset" method.  This is because methods cannot have non-word characters in them.
          From, Subject, and Precedence headers may also be accessed via headset, if you so choose.
        - AUTOLOAD now complains loudly (setting ->error and printing to STDERR) if it's called.

.91   Wed Aug 11, 1999
        - Fixed bugs in setting values which require validation checks.
        - Fixed accessing of non-standard headers so that the returns are identical
          to every other accesor method.

.90   Tue Aug 10, 1999
        - Initial "completed" release.  First release available to general public.
