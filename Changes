Revision history for Perl module Mail::Bulkmail.

3.03 Fri Jan 24, 2003
	- Fixed a potentially disasterous bug that could cause the system to hang infinitely if there's a severely mal-formed Message
	- fixed a minor logging error that could cause some errors to be logged twice
	- DummyServer now says EHLO, to be consistent with Server
	- if using a coderef for logging/reading, now gets the bulkmail object as its first argument
	- Mail::Bulkmail::Server now has a CONVERSATION log, to aid in debugging.
	- Magically fixed another bug in envelope sending. I can't say exactly what it was or how it was fixed or when it manifested itself, but
	  it was there. (again, many thanks to Tim de Wolf for his continued help in tracking this down)

3.02 Thu Jan 23, 2003
	- Fixed a bug in envelope sending that I can't believe I managed to allow into the final release.
	  (many thanks to Tim de Wolf for finding this and helping me isolate it)
	- fixed some documentation errors in the examples
	- now logs to ERRFILE if the server didn't accept an EHLO
	- doesn't skip current email address if there's an error on the previous one
	- fixed a ridiculously obscure bug that could manifest with an invalid Sender
	- headers weren't *quite* RFC 2822 compliant (they were still valid RFC 822)

3.01 Thu Jan 23, 2003

	- Fixed an annoylingly old bug in setting the envelope header which could
	  cause an invalid address to be sent (thanks to Joseph Brown for identifying this)
	- removed the debugging routine that required Data::Dumper

3.00 Mon Jan 20, 2003

	- Componentized the code.
	  (Mail::Bulkmail, Mail::Bulkmail::Dynamic, Mail::Bulkmail::Server, etc.)
	- Added multiple server support.
	- added support for timing out if there's no reply from a server
	- Finally fixed the damn Tz bug.
	- Cleaned up the code an awful lot.
	- General bug fixes, etc.
	- Brand spanking new docs.
	- Errors now return error codes as well as error text
	- should be fully RFC 2821 and RFC 2822 compliant
	- defaults now set in a conf file

2.05  Tues Oct 3, 2000
	- Added envelope_limit accessor.
	- You can now set more defaults yourself.
	- Cleaned up the documentation a lot.
	- Re-wrote the date generation methods.  They're now 5-10%
	  faster and I fixed an *old* bug causing mail to sometimes
	  appear to have been sent yesterday, or tomorrow.
    - Altered logging when using the envelope, see item GOOD, above.
    - Fixed a bug with undefined values in mailmerges

2.04  Tues Aug 29, 2000
	- Added log_full_line flag.
	- Trusting is now more trusting.
	- Domains can once again be banned.
	- Error checking is done less often and in a slightly 
	  different order now
	- ->bulkmail now returns 1 on success.  Doh.
	- Fixed an annoyingly subtle bug with construction of 
	  dynamic messages
	- Repaired a long-standing bug in the docs.

2.03  Tues Aug 22, 2000
	- Tweaked the constructor
	- Enhanced the 'error' method so it can behave as a 
	  class method
	- Enhanced HFM
	- Enhanced the test suite
	- various bug fixes

2.01  Wed Aug 16, 2000
	- Fixed a mindnumblingly dumb bug whereby merge and 
	  dynamic hashes weren't initialized.

2.00  Fri Aug 11, 2000
	- Re-wrote everything.  Literally _everything_.  Total 
	  re-write.  
	- Added in support for dynamic messaging.
	- Added in support for envelope sending.
	- Added in ability to import lists from more sources.
	- Mail::Bulkmail should now behave absolutely perfectly 
	  with -w and use strict.
	- Did I mention that this is a ground-up re-write?  Your 
	  existing code will need to be tweaked slightly to use
	  the new module.


1.11  Tue Nov 09, 1999
	- Banned addresses now checks entire address case 
	  insensitively instead of leaving the local part
	  alone. Better safe than sorry.
	- $self->fmdl is now used to split BULK_FILEMAP
	- Various fixes suggested by Chris Nandor to make -w 
	  shut up.
	- Changed the way to provide local maps to mail and 
	  bulkmail so it's more intuitive.

1.10  Wed Sep 08, 1999 
	- Several little fixes.
	- The module will now re-connect if it receives a 221 
	  (connection terminated) message from the server.
	- Fixed a potential near-infinite loop in the 
	  _valid_email routine.
	- _valid_email now merrily strips away comments 
	  (even nested ones).  :)
	- hfm (headers from message) method added.
	- fmdl (filemap delimiter) method added.

1.01  Wed Sep, 01, 1999
	- Fixed a bug in the email validation routine which
	  would cause the module to hang severely on certain 
	  malformed addresses.  All is once again right with 
	  the world.
	- Altered default date generation to be RFC 1123 
	  compliant (4 digit year)
	- changed date generation so that it adds a space after
	  the comma after the day.  This is because of a bug in 
	  Outlook that wouldn't recognize the date w/o the space.

1.00  Wed Aug 18, 1999 
	- First public release onto CPAN
      
0.93  Thu Aug 12, 1999
	- Re-vamped the documentation substantially.

0.92  Thu Aug 12, 1999
	- Started adding a zero in front of the version name, 
	  just like I always should have
	- Changed accessing of non-standard headers so that they
	  have to be accessed and retrieved via the "headset" 
	  method.  This is because methods cannot have non-word 
	  characters in them.  From, Subject, and Precedence 
	  headers may also be accessed via headset, if you so 
	  choose.
	- AUTOLOAD now complains loudly (setting ->error and 
	  printing to STDERR) if it's called.

.91   Wed Aug 11, 1999
	- Fixed bugs in setting values which require validation
	  checks.
	- Fixed accessing of non-standard headers so that the 
	  returns are identical to every other accesor method.

.90   Tue Aug 10, 1999
	- Initial "completed" release.  First release available
	  to general public.
