Revision history for Perl extension Mail::Bulkmail.

2.01  Wed Aug 16, 2000
	- Fixed a mindnumblingly dumb bug whereby merge and dynamic hashes weren't initialized.

2.00  Fri Aug 11, 2000
        - Re-wrote everything.  Literally _everything_.  Total re-write.  
        - Added in support for dynamic messaging.
        - Added in support for envelope sending.
        - Added in ability to import lists from more sources.
        - Mail::Bulkmail should now behave absolutely perfectly with -w and use strict.
        - Did I mention that this is a ground-up re-write?  Your existing code will need
          to be tweaked slightly to use the new module.


1.11  Tue Nov 09, 1999
        - Banned addresses now checks entire address case
          insensitively instead of leaving the local part
          alone. Better safe than sorry.
        - $self->fmdl is now used to split BULK_FILEMAP
        - Various fixes suggested by Chris Nandor to make -w
          shut up.
        - Changed the way to provide local maps to mail and
          bulkmail so it's more intuitive.

1.10  Wed Sep 08, 1999 
        - Several little fixes.
        - The module will now re-connect if it receives a 221 (connection terminated) 
          message from the server.
        - Fixed a potential near-infinite loop in the _valid_email routine.
        - _valid_email now merrily strips away comments (even nested ones).  :)
        - hfm (headers from message) method added.
        - fmdl (filemap delimiter) method added.

1.01  Wed Sep, 01, 1999
        - Fixed a bug in the email validation routine which would cause the module to hang severely
          on certain malformed addresses.  All is once again right with the world
        - Altered default date generation to be RFC 1123 compliant (4 digit year)
        - changed date generation so that it adds a space after the comman after the day.
          This is because of a bug in Outlook that wouldn't recognize the date w/o the space.

1.00  Wed Aug 18, 1999 
        - First public release onto CPAN
      
0.93  Thu Aug 12, 1999
        - Re-vamped the documentation substantially.

0.92  Thu Aug 12, 1999
        - Started adding a zero in front of the version name, just like I always should have
        - Changed accessing of non-standard headers so that they have to be accessed and retrieved
          via the "headset" method.  This is because methods cannot have non-word characters in them.
          From, Subject, and Precedence headers may also be accessed via headset, if you so choose.
        - AUTOLOAD now complains loudly (setting ->error and printing to STDERR) if it's called.

.91   Wed Aug 11, 1999
        - Fixed bugs in setting values which require validation checks.
        - Fixed accessing of non-standard headers so that the returns are identical
          to every other accesor method.

.90   Tue Aug 10, 1999
        - Initial "completed" release.  First release available to general public.
