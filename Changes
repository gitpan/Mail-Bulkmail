Revision history for Perl module Mail::Bulkmail.

3.10 Tue Nov 25, 2003
	- message_from_file was hopelessly broken. Now fixed.
	- valid_email now returns a hash (see the pod)
	- extractEmail now returns a hash (see the pod)
	- added extractSender and extractReplyTo for dynamic senders and replies-to
	- added the errvals method
	- Timeouts were still breaking under Windows. Now fixed.
	  (thanks to Finn Smith for pointing this out)
	- Fixed a pod formatting flaw
	  (thanks to Todd Karlsson for pointing this out)
	- error now just returns (additionally appropriately returning void in a void context)

3.09 Fri Apr 04, 2003
	- Mail::Bulkmail::Dynamic wasn't properly doubling periods. Oops.
	  (thanks to Matthew Williams for pointing this out)
	- Gah. Mail::Bulkmail::DummyServer had some crap in it regarding how filehandles
	  were created and passed. 5.8.0 would complain about it.
	  (many thanks to Christ Faust for giving me info to help track this down)
	- as per request, added a space after the : in the headers
	- added a fileno test on the socket to prevent printing on a closed filehandle
	- added a 'no warnings "portable"' to make 5.8 shut up
	- added a few more examples to the docs

3.08 Sat Mar 29, 2003
	- Damn this makes me mad. Turns out I was doubling periods and *then* wrapping the message.
	  In some unlikely circumstances, that could cause a lone period on a line in the middle of
	  a message, which is, of course, bad. Now does doubling after wrapping.
	  (thanks to Guy Matz for pointing this out!)

3.07 Fri Mar 28, 2003
	- Fixed a stupid little bug that should not have slipped by me.
	  (thanks to Guy Matz for pointing this out!)
	- broke the version numbers back out into the individual modules, so CPAN wouldn't bitch

3.06 Tue Mar 25, 2003
	- No longer even attempts to connect to a server if you haven't specified the Tries parameter
	- You can now change the text of the Message after bulkmailing or mailing
	  (This means you may change the non-merged, non-dynamic text via a new call to ->Message,
	   it is recommended that you do not do this unless you know why you are doing it. dynamic
	   messages and mail merges will do what you want 99% of the time)
	- added some entries to the FAQ
	- ->error now returns () in a list context, undef in a scalar context
	- added some more documentation
	- the constructor now operates on passed keys/values in the order they were passed
	- added message_from_file flag to load in a message from a file on disk
	- added headers_from_message to extract message headers from the value passed to ->Message
	- you may now unset From, To, Sender, Reply-To headers by calling the relevant method and passing an undef
	  as customary with the returns from ->header, will return 0 if you successfully set a header to undef
	- if you wish, for some foolish reason, to name one of your log files "0", you may now do that.

3.05 Thu Feb 6, 2003
	- *mutter* fixed a flaw in my test suite
	  (thanks to an error reported by Ben Wrigley)
	- added the migration guide (migration.guide.txt)
	- adjusted how Mail::Bulkmail::Dynamic internally handles headers
	- fixed some documentation errors
	- tweaked some of the code to look more consistent
	- Mail::Bulkmail::Dynamic no longer incorrectly requires  a ->To header to be set.
	  (again, thanks to Ben Wrigley)

3.04 Tue Feb 4, 2003
	- setting a header to undef now deletes it, instead of storing it in the hash as undef.
	  This wasn't terribly important, since the header wouldn't be set in the message if it
	  was empty, but it was good for consistency's sake. Also, if you set a header to undef,
	  the method now returns 0, for a non-true but defined value.
	- All $VERSION numbers now reference the master version number in Mail::Bulkmail::Object
	- Fixed a bug where trying to call ->header in Mail::Bulkmail::Dynamic w/o using
	  dynamic_header_data would cause a crash.
	  (thanks to Justin Simoni for catching this)
	- added the ->errstring convenience method (in Mail::Bulkmail::Object)
	- Will now bubble up error codes from methods called at construction instead of replacing
	  with the default code. Still uses the default codes if one is not passed.
	- Fixed an obscure error that might have caused a slightly incorrect error message
	  if there's a failure during construction.
	- Wrappered the alarm calls in evals to catch them on systems that don't implement it.
	  (like some stupid versions of activeperl on windows)

3.03 Fri Jan 24, 2003
	- Fixed a potentially disasterous bug that could cause the system to hang
	  infinitely if there's a severely mal-formed Message
	- fixed a minor logging error that could cause some errors to be logged twice
	- DummyServer now says EHLO, to be consistent with Server
	- if using a coderef for logging/reading, now gets the bulkmail object as its first argument
	- Mail::Bulkmail::Server now has a CONVERSATION log, to aid in debugging.
	- Magically fixed another bug in envelope sending. I can't say exactly what it was or how it 
	  was fixed or when it manifested itself, but it was there.
	  (again, many thanks to Tim de Wolf for his continued help in tracking this down)

3.02 Thu Jan 23, 2003
	- Fixed a bug in envelope sending that I can't believe I managed to allow into the final release.
	  (many thanks to Tim de Wolf for finding this and helping me isolate it)
	- fixed some documentation errors in the examples
	- now logs to ERRFILE if the server didn't accept an EHLO
	- doesn't skip current email address if there's an error on the previous one
	- fixed a ridiculously obscure bug that could manifest with an invalid Sender
	- headers weren't *quite* RFC 2822 compliant (they were still valid RFC 822)

3.01 Thu Jan 23, 2003

	- Fixed an annoylingly old bug in setting the envelope header which could
	  cause an invalid address to be sent (thanks to Joseph Brown for identifying this)
	- removed the debugging routine that required Data::Dumper

3.00 Mon Jan 20, 2003

	- Componentized the code.
	  (Mail::Bulkmail, Mail::Bulkmail::Dynamic, Mail::Bulkmail::Server, etc.)
	- Added multiple server support.
	- added support for timing out if there's no reply from a server
	- Finally fixed the damn Tz bug.
	- Cleaned up the code an awful lot.
	- General bug fixes, etc.
	- Brand spanking new docs.
	- Errors now return error codes as well as error text
	- should be fully RFC 2821 and RFC 2822 compliant
	- defaults now set in a conf file

2.05  Tues Oct 3, 2000
	- Added envelope_limit accessor.
	- You can now set more defaults yourself.
	- Cleaned up the documentation a lot.
	- Re-wrote the date generation methods.  They're now 5-10%
	  faster and I fixed an *old* bug causing mail to sometimes
	  appear to have been sent yesterday, or tomorrow.
    - Altered logging when using the envelope, see item GOOD, above.
    - Fixed a bug with undefined values in mailmerges

2.04  Tues Aug 29, 2000
	- Added log_full_line flag.
	- Trusting is now more trusting.
	- Domains can once again be banned.
	- Error checking is done less often and in a slightly
	  different order now
	- ->bulkmail now returns 1 on success.  Doh.
	- Fixed an annoyingly subtle bug with construction of
	  dynamic messages
	- Repaired a long-standing bug in the docs.

2.03  Tues Aug 22, 2000
	- Tweaked the constructor
	- Enhanced the 'error' method so it can behave as a
	  class method
	- Enhanced HFM
	- Enhanced the test suite
	- various bug fixes

2.01  Wed Aug 16, 2000
	- Fixed a mindnumblingly dumb bug whereby merge and
	  dynamic hashes weren't initialized.

2.00  Fri Aug 11, 2000
	- Re-wrote everything.  Literally _everything_.  Total
	  re-write.
	- Added in support for dynamic messaging.
	- Added in support for envelope sending.
	- Added in ability to import lists from more sources.
	- Mail::Bulkmail should now behave absolutely perfectly
	  with -w and use strict.
	- Did I mention that this is a ground-up re-write?  Your
	  existing code will need to be tweaked slightly to use
	  the new module.


1.11  Tue Nov 09, 1999
	- Banned addresses now checks entire address case
	  insensitively instead of leaving the local part
	  alone. Better safe than sorry.
	- $self->fmdl is now used to split BULK_FILEMAP
	- Various fixes suggested by Chris Nandor to make -w
	  shut up.
	- Changed the way to provide local maps to mail and
	  bulkmail so it's more intuitive.

1.10  Wed Sep 08, 1999
	- Several little fixes.
	- The module will now re-connect if it receives a 221
	  (connection terminated) message from the server.
	- Fixed a potential near-infinite loop in the
	  _valid_email routine.
	- _valid_email now merrily strips away comments
	  (even nested ones).  :)
	- hfm (headers from message) method added.
	- fmdl (filemap delimiter) method added.

1.01  Wed Sep, 01, 1999
	- Fixed a bug in the email validation routine which
	  would cause the module to hang severely on certain
	  malformed addresses.  All is once again right with
	  the world.
	- Altered default date generation to be RFC 1123
	  compliant (4 digit year)
	- changed date generation so that it adds a space after
	  the comma after the day.  This is because of a bug in
	  Outlook that wouldn't recognize the date w/o the space.

1.00  Wed Aug 18, 1999
	- First public release onto CPAN

0.93  Thu Aug 12, 1999
	- Re-vamped the documentation substantially.

0.92  Thu Aug 12, 1999
	- Started adding a zero in front of the version name,
	  just like I always should have
	- Changed accessing of non-standard headers so that they
	  have to be accessed and retrieved via the "headset"
	  method.  This is because methods cannot have non-word
	  characters in them.  From, Subject, and Precedence
	  headers may also be accessed via headset, if you so
	  choose.
	- AUTOLOAD now complains loudly (setting ->error and
	  printing to STDERR) if it's called.

.91   Wed Aug 11, 1999
	- Fixed bugs in setting values which require validation
	  checks.
	- Fixed accessing of non-standard headers so that the
	  returns are identical to every other accesor method.

.90   Tue Aug 10, 1999
	- Initial "completed" release.  First release available
	  to general public.
