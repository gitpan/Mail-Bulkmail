=head1 NAME

Mail::Bulkmail::Server - handles server connections and communication for Mail::Bulkmail

=head1 AUTHOR

Jim Thomason, jim@jimandkoka.com

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 my $server = Mail::Bulkmail::Server->new(
 	'Smtp' => 'your.smtp.com',
 	'Port' => 25
 ) || die Mail::Bulkmail::Server->error();

 #connect to the SMTP relay
 $server->connect || die $server->error();

 #talk to the server
 my $response = $server->talk_and_respond("RSET");

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Mail::Bulkmail::Server now handles server connections. Mail::Bulkmail 1.x and 2.x had all the server functionality
built into the module itself. That was nice in terms of simplicity - one module, one connection, one server, and
so on. But it had some downsides. For one thing, it only allowed for one connection. And since I wanted to allow
multiple server connections in 3.00, that had to go. For another, it was a pain in the butt to change the server
implementation. This way, you can easily write your own server class, drop it in here, and be off to the races.

For example, the Mail::Bulkmail::DummyServer module for debugging purposes.

This is not a module that you'll really need to access directly, since it is accessed internally by Mail::Bulkmail
when it is needed. Specify the data you need in the conf file and the server_file attribute, and you won't
ever need to touch this directly.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=over 11

=item Smtp

stores the Smtp relay's address.

 $server->Smtp("your.smtp.com");

can either be an IP or a named address

Smtp values should be set in your server file.

=cut

__PACKAGE__->add_attr('Smtp');

=pod

=item Port

stores the port on which you'll try to connect to the SMTP relay. Probably going to be 25, since that's the
standard SMTP port.

 $server->Port(25);

Port values should be set in either your server file, or a single default in your conf file.

=cut

__PACKAGE__->add_attr('Port');

=pod

=item Domain

When you connect to an SMTP server, you must say hello and state your domain. This is your domain that you
use to say hello.

 $server->Domain('mydomain.com');

This should be the same name of the domain of the machine that you are connecting on.

Domain should be set in your conf file.

=cut

__PACKAGE__->add_attr('Domain');

=pod

=item Tries

When you try to connect to an SMTP server via ->connect, you may have issues with creating the socket
or making the connection. Tries specifies how many times you should re-try making the socket or making
the connection before failing to connect.

Make this a small number.

 $server->Tries(5);

Tries should be set in your conf file.

=cut

__PACKAGE__->add_attr('Tries');

=pod

=item max_connection_attempts

This is similar to Tries, but this governs the number of times that you can call the ->connect method.
When you have multiple servers in Mail::Bulkmail's ->servers array, there's no point in constantly re-trying
to connect to a server that fails. it'll just slow you down. max_connection_attempts makes sure that you stop
trying to connect to invalid servers.

Make this a small number as well.

 $server->max_connection_attempts(7);

max_connection_attempts should be set in your conf file.

=cut

__PACKAGE__->add_attr('max_connection_attempts');

=pod

=item envelope_limit

It's entirely likely that with a very large list you'll have a very large number of people in the
same domain.  For instance, there are an awful lot of people that have yahoo addresses.  So, for example,
say that you have a list of 100,000 people and 20,000 of them are in the yahoo.com domain and you're sending
using the envelope.  That means that the server at yahoo.com is going to receive one message with 20,000
people in the envelope!

Now, this might be a bad thing.  We don't know if the yahoo.com mail server will actually process a message
with 20,000 envelope recipients.  It may or may not and the only way to find out is to try it.  If it does work,
then great no worries. But if it doesn't, then you're stuck.  If you stop using envelope sending, you sacrifice
its major speed gains, but if you keep using it you can't send to yahoo.com.

I<envelope_limit> fixes that.

envelope_limit is precisely what it sounds like, it allows you to specify a limit on the number of recipients
that will be specified in your envelope.  That way, with our previous example, you can specify an envelope limit of
1000, for example.

 $bulk->envelope_limit(1000);

This means that yahoo.com will get 20 messages, each with 1000 recipients in the envelope.  Of course, this still
may not be small enough, so you can tweak it as much as necessary.

Setting an envelope limit does trade off some of the gains from using the envelope, but it's still over all
a vast speed boost over not using it.

envelope_limit should be set in your conf file. I recommend setting it to 100, but tweak it as necessary. Higher values
allow you to send more information and do it faster, but you're more likely to run into server's that refuse that many
recipients. Lower values are more compatible, but slightly slower.

Set envelope_limit to 0 for an infinite limit. You should never have to set it below 100 (unless you're using an infinite limit),
since RFC 2822 says that SMTP servers should always accept at least 100 recipients in the envelope

=cut

__PACKAGE__->add_attr('envelope_limit');

=pod

=item max_messages

max_messages sets the maximum number of messages to send to a particular server. This is mainly useful if you're bulkmailing
to multiple servers. You may have a server that can take some of the load, but not much of it. Assume that your list has over
100,000 people on it, and you're using one primary SMTP relay and one smaller SMTP relay to help take some of the load off
of the main one. Your primary SMTP server can handle lots of messages, but your smaller one can only take a smaller load.
That'd a good place for max_messages.

 $aux_server->max_messages(10000);

That way, your smaller server will relay no more than 10,000 messages.

Set max_messages to 0 for an infinite number of messages to go through the server. It is recommended to set max_messages
to 0.

=cut

__PACKAGE__->add_attr('max_messages');

=pod

=item max_messages_per_robin

when you set up your bulkmail object with multiple servers, max_messages_per_robin is used to determine how many messages
are sent to a server before moving onto the next.

This is the maximum number of messages that would be sent to a server in a given iteration before moving on to the next,
but it is not necessarily the exact number of messages that will be sent. If the server has reached the maximum number of
messages allowed, or the maximum number in a given connection, it will jump to the next server before reaching
the robin limit.

Set max_messages_per_robin to 0 for an infinite number of messages allowed on a given server iteration. It is recommended
to set this to 500 if you're using multiple servers, and to 0 if you're using 1 server.

The message robin counter is reset by reset_all_counters

=cut

__PACKAGE__->add_attr('max_messages_per_robin');

=pod

=item max_messages_per_connection

This sets the maximum number of messages that would be sent to a given SMTP relay in a given connection.
When this limit is reached, the server will disconnect and return that it has reached a limit.

set max_messages_per_connection to 0 for infinite messages per connection. It is recommended to keep this at 0.

The message connection counter is reset by reset_all_counters

=cut

__PACKAGE__->add_attr('max_messages_per_connection');

=pod

=item max_messages_while_awake

Sometimes, it may be useful to pause and give your server a break. max_messages_while_awake allows this. This will
specify the number of messages to send to a server before going to sleep for a certain period of time.

 $server->max_messages_while_awake(100);

Will send 100 messages to the server and then go to sleep. for the time specified by sleep_length.

Note that reaching this limit will not cause reached_limit to return a true value, so in a multi-server environment, you'll
end up sleeping a lot.

The message-while-awake counter is reset by reset_all_counters, so it is of dubious utility when using multiple servers.

Set max_messages_while_awake to 0 to never sleep. It is recommended to have max_messages_while_awake set to 0 when using
multiple servers. Set it to a positive number when using one server.

=cut

__PACKAGE__->add_attr('max_messages_while_awake');

=pod

=item sleep_length

Specifies the time to sleep (in seconds) if the server has reached the max_messages_while_awake limit.

=cut

__PACKAGE__->add_attr('sleep_length');

=pod

=item talk_attempts

The response codes for SMTP are pretty rigorously defined, which is obviously very usefull. a 5xy error is permanently fatal.
a 4xy error is temporarily fatal. It is recommended that if a 4xy error is encountered, that the client (us) should try re-sending
the same command again. talk_attempts specifies the number of times to try resending a command after receiving a 400 level error
from the server.

 $server->talk_attempts(5);

=cut

__PACKAGE__->add_attr('talk_attempts');

=pod

=item time_out

We can *finally* time out! So if your SMTP relay doesn't respond for a set period of time, the connection will automatically
disconnect and fail with an error. Set this to something high, the value is in seconds.

 $server->time_out(3000);	# 5 minutes

=cut

__PACKAGE__->add_attr('time_out');

=pod

=item time_of_last_message

stores the time that the last message was sent through this server, in epoch seconds.

=cut

__PACKAGE__->add_attr('time_of_last_message');

Don't set this value, only read it.

__PACKAGE__->add_attr('_sent_messages_this_connection');

# sleep_length is specified
__PACKAGE__->add_attr('_sent_messages_while_awake');

=pod

=item CONVERSATION

This is an optional log file to keep track of your SMTP conversations

CONVERSATION may be either a coderef, globref, arrayref, or string literal.

If a string literal, then Mail::Bulkmail::Server will attempt to open that file (in append mode) as your log:

 $server->CONVERSATION("/path/to/my/conversation");

If a globref, it is assumed to be an open filehandle in append mode:

 open (C, ">>/path/to/my/conversation");
 $server->CONVERSATION(\*C);

if a coderef, it is assumed to be a function to call with the address as an argument:

 sub C { print "CONVERSATION : ", $_[1], "\n"};	#or whatever your code is
 $server->CONVERSATION(\&C);

if an arrayref, then the conversation will be pushed on to the end of it

 $server->CONVERSATION(\@conversation);

Use whichever item is most convenient, and Mail::Bulkmail::Server will take it from there.

B<Be warned>: This file is going to get B<huge>. Massively huge. You should only turn this on for debugging
purposes and B<never> in a production environment. It will log the first 50 characters of a message sent to the
server, and the full server response.

=head1 METHODS

=over 11

=item increment_messages_sent

This method will increment the server object's internal counters storing the total number of messages
sent, the total sent this robin, the total sent this connection, the total sent while awake, and the total
sent this envelope.

It will also store the time the last message is sent.

This message will reset the internal counters for the messages sent this robin, messages sent this connection,
and messages sent while awake back to 0.

=cut

=item reset_envelope_counter

The envelope counter behaves slightly differently than the other counters, so we have a separate method to reset the internal
envelope counter.

=item reached_limit

This method will tell you if the server has reached the max_messages, max_messages_per_connection, or max_messages_per_robin
limits. Also, if you reach the max_messages_while_awake limit, this method will cause you to sleep for the time period
specified in sleep_length

 Return values:
 1 : reached max_messages limit, server becomes worthless and will not be used again
 2 : reached max_messages_per_connection limit, server will disconnect
 3 : reached max_messages_per_robin limit

=item disconnect

disconnects the server object from the SMTP relay. Before disconnect, it will issue a "RSET" and then a "quit" command
to the SMTP server, then close the socket. disconnect sets ->connected to 0.

disconnect can also disconnect quietly, i.e., it won't try to issue a RSET and then quit before closing the socket.

=item create_all_servers

create_all_servers will iterate through the file specified in server_file in the conf file and return an arrayref of all
server objects created.

 define package Mail::Bulkmail::Server

 server_file	= ./server_file.txt

your server file should be of the format of another Mail::Bulkmail conf file, containing definitions
for all of the SMTP servers you want to use. See the examples below for how to set up the conf files.

If you would like to specify a different conf file, pass that as an argument.

 my $servers = Mail::Bulkmail::Server->create_all_servers('/path/to/new/server_file.txt');

This will then ignore the server_file in the conf file and use the one passed.

You may also pass hashrefs of init data for new servers.

 my $servers = Mail::Bulkmail::Server->create_all_servers(
 	{
 		'Smtp' => 'smtp.yourdomain.com'
 	},
 	{
 		'Smtp' => 'smtp2.yourdomain.com'
 	},
 	{
 		'Smtp' => 'smtp3.yourdomain.com'
 	}
 ) || die Mail::Bulkmail::Server->error;

This is called internally by Mail::Bulkmail's constructor, so you probably won't ever need to touch it.

=head1 SAMPLE SERVER FILE

It is recommended that you define your server entries in your server file. See Mail::Bulkmail::Object and Mail::Bulkmail
for more information on conf file set up and how to define your server_file.

 #in your conf file, you want this
 define package Mail::Bulkmail::Server

 #your server file
 server_file = /etc/mb/server.file.txt

Now, your server file should look like this:

 define package Mail::Bulkmail::Server

 #set up the first server
 Smtp @= smtp1.yourdomain.com
 Port @= 25
 Tries @= 5
 max_messages_per_robin @= 1000
 envelope_limit @= 100

 #set up the second server
 Smtp @= smtp2.yourdomain.com
 Port @= 25
 Tries @= 5
 max_messages_per_robin @= 1000
 envelope_limit @= 100

 #set up the third server
 Smtp @= smtp3.yourdomain.com
 Port @= 25
 Tries @= 5
 max_messages_per_robin @= 1000
 envelope_limit @= 100

Alternatively, you can use defaults in your master conf file.

 #your server file
 server_file = /etc/mb/server.file.txt

 #These values will apply to all servers
 Port = 25
 Tries = 5
 max_message_per_robin = 1000
 envelope_limit = 100

Now, your server file should look like this:

 define package Mail::Bulkmail::Server

 #set up the first server
 Smtp @= smtp1.yourdomain.com

 #set up the second server
 Smtp @= smtp2.yourdomain.com

 #set up the third server
 Smtp @= smtp3.yourdomain.com

Be warned that if you want to set up a value for one server, you should set it up for all of them. Either
specify the attribute for a server in the master conf file, or specify it multiple times for all servers.
