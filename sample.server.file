define package Mail::Bulkmail::Server

#we've already set up the server defaults in sample.cfg.file, so here we
#just need to define a list of Smtp servers

Smtp @= smtp1.mydomain.com
Smtp @= smtp2.mydomain.com
Smtp @= smtp3.mydomain.com

#of course, you may add as many smtp servers as you'd like. 3 isn't a magic number or anything.
